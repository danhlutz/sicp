# Adding new types and operations

## Adding new types
A data-directed approach would be more flexible for a system in which new types are often.

When a new type is added, the developer would need to add a new package implementing the given gneeric operations for the new type. 

However, when a new operation is added that should work on different types, each package must be updated to implement the new operation

## Adding new operations

A message passing strategy would be more effective when new operations are often added, but the types rarely change. 

To add a new operation, you would add a new conditional clause to each type implementing the operation for that type.

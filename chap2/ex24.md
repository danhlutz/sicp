# evaluating a nested list

## evaluation by the interpreter

```scheme
> (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))
(1 (2 (3 4)))
```

## box and pointer structure

(We'll indicate a box as an 'o' and nil as '/')

```
o o -> o /  
|      |
1      o o -> o /
       |      |
       2      o o -> o /
              |      |
              3      4
```

## tree representation

```
 / \
1  / \
  2  / \
    3   4
```

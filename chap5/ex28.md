# Eliminating tail recursion

Here are the results of running a tail-recursive
version of FACTORIAL without tail recursion in the evaluator

## "Tail" recursive version

The tail recursion version no longer operates in constant space

The amount of space needed grows linearly

Pushes    = ``` (+ (* n 37) 33) ```
Max Depth = ``` (+ (* n 3) 14) ```

## Regular recursive version

This version also requires linearly-growing space -- 
but it needs twice as much space as the tail recursive version :)

Pushes    =  ``` (+ (* n 34) 18) ```
Max Depth =  ``` (+ (* n 6) 11) ```

# Extending the evaluator

Extend the evaluator to add COND and LET

We will assume that cond->if and let->combination are available 
as machine operations

```
eval-dispatch
...
  (test (op cond?) (reg exp))
  (branch (label cond->if))
  (test (op let?) (reg exp))
  (branch (label let->lambda))

cond->if
  (assign exp (op cond->if) (reg exp))
  (goto (label eval-dispatch))

let->lambda
  (assign exp (op lambda->combination) (reg exp))
  (goto (label eval-dispatch))
```

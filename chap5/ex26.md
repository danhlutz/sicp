# Tail recursion performance

We're measuring the performance of a tail-recursive procedure

```
(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* product counter)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
```

```
N    STACK-OPS   MAX STACK DEPTH
0      29         8
1      64        10
2      99        10
3     134        10
5     204        10
50   1779        10
```

The maximum stack depth is 10. 

The number of stack operations needed to find n!
is ``` (+ (* n 35) 29) ```

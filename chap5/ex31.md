# Superfluous stack operations

```
(f 'x 'y)
```

We do not need to use any stack operations. We just need to look up
the values of f, x, and y

```
((f) 'x 'y)
```

We need to save ENV while evaluating the value of f

```
(f (g 'x) y)
(f (g 'x) 'y)
```

When evaluating the first operand we need to save ENV, ARGL, and PROC

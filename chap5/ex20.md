# Representing pairs with vectors

```
(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (list x x))
```

## box and pointer representation

y -> [ * ] [ * ] -> [ * ] [ / ]
       |              |
       | /------------+
       vv
x -> [ * ] [ * ]
       |     |
       v     v
       1     2

## memory vector representation
           0     1     2     3     4     5     6
the-cars [    ][ n1 ][ p1 ][ p1 ][    ][    ][    ]
the-cdrs [    ][ n2 ][ p2 ][ e0 ][    ][    ][    ]

The final value of free is 4

The value of x is p1
The value of y is p2

# a factorial register machine

We're going to implement the following factorial definition as a register
machine

```
(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* product counter)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
```

## the register machine

```
 +--> [ product ]  +--> [ counter ] --> ( > )
 |         |       |     /   |            |
 |         |       |    /    |          / n \
 |         |       |   /     |
 |         v       |  |      v
 |      \ mul /<------+   \ +1 /
 |         |       |         |
 |         v       |         v
 +----- [ np ]     +------ [ nc ]
```

## the control structure

```
         start
           |
           v
+------> ( > ) ---> yes: answer in product
|          | 
|          | no
|          v
|     [ np <- mul] multiply product and counter and set np register
|          |
|          v
|     [ nc <- +1 ] add 1 to the counter and set the nc register
|          |
|          v
|     [ p <- np  ] set the product register from the np register
|          |
|          v
|     [ c <- nc  ] set the counter register from the nc register
|          |

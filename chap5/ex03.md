# calculating square roots

Let's represent sqrt as a register-machine

```
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x) 0.001)))
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))
```

## assuming good-enough? and improve are primitives

```
(controller
  sqrt
    (assign x (op read))
    (assign guess 1.0)
  sqrt-iter
    (test (op good-enough?) (reg guess) (reg x))
    (branch (label sqrt-done))
    (assign guess (op improve) (reg guess) (reg x))
    (goto (label sqrt-iter))
  sqrt-done
    (perform (op print) (reg guess))
    (goto (label sqrt)))
```

## implementing good-enough? and improve

```
(controller
  sqrt
    (assign x (op read))
    (assign guess 1.0)
  good-enough?
    (assign t (op square) (reg guess))
    (assign t (op -) (reg t) (reg x))
    (assign t (op abs) (reg t))
    (test (op <) (reg t) (const 0.001))
    (branch (label sqrt-done))
  improve
    (assign t (op /) (reg x) (reg guess))
    (assign guess (op avg) (reg guess) (reg t))
    (goto (label good-enough?))
  sqrt-done
    (perform (op print) (reg guess))
    (goto (label sqrt)))
```

## and using just basic arithmetic

```
(controller
  sqrt
    (assign x (op read))
    (assign guess 1.0)
  good-enough?
    (assign t (op *) (reg guess) (reg guess))
    (assign t (op -) (reg t) (reg x))
    (test (op <) (reg t) (const 0))
    (branch (label abs))
  compare-to-tolerance
    (test (op <) (reg t) (const 0.001))
    (branch (label sqrt-done))
    (goto (label improve))
  abs
    (assign t (op -) (const 0) (reg t))
    (goto (label compare-to-tolerance))
  improve
    (assign t (op /) (reg x) (reg guess))
    (assign t (op +) (reg guess) (reg t))
    (assign guess (op /) (reg t) (const 2))
    (goto (label good-enough?))
  sqrt-done
    (perform (op print) (reg guess))
    (goto (label sqrt)))
```

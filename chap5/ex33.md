# comparing two different versions of factorial

Does changing the order of the operands in the recursive case
of factorial change the efficiency of the calculation? 

I calculated (factorial 6) and (factorial-alt 6)

## code efficiency

```
(factorial 6)
STACK PUSHES: 33
MAX DEPTH: 17
INSTRUCTION COUNT: 270

(factorial-alt 6)
STACK-PUSHES: 33
MAX DEPTH: 17
INSTRUCTION COUNT: 270

There is no difference in code efficiency
```

## compiled code for factorial-alt

Below is the compiled code for FACTORIAL-ALT

It includes the *EXACT SAME* operations as FACTORIAL, just 
in a different order. That explains why the number of instructions
needed to calculate a factorial is *EXACTLY THE SAME* using either
compiled procedure.

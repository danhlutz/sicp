# adding map

I was able to add a simplified version of map to my interpreter with the definition

```
(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car items))
            (map proc (cdr items)))))
            ```

This gave me a map function that worked on one list. However I was not
able to implement a map function that worked on multiple lists. 

This could be Louis's problem. The Scheme implementation of map 
relies on dotted tail notation, which our interpreter does not yet support.

# finding the value of the operator

In cases when we apply a compound operator to a procedure, we 
need to find the actual value of the operator before we apply it. 

For example, if we evaluate
```
((lambda (n) (if (< n 0) (- n) n)) -13)
```

We get 13, or the absolute value of the operand. 
In this case it was necessary to find the actual value of the procedure
before we could evaluate the rest.

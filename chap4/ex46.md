# parsing order

Parsing relies on evalution proceeding from left to right
because of the way that parse-word chooses the car 
of *unparsed* to attempt to parse what is next.

This means that in order to starting parsing the verb part of a sentence
parse-words requires that the noun-phrase components have been removed

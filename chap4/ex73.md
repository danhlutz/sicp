# INTERLEAVE in STREAM-FLATMAP

The second argument to INTERLEAVE in STREAM-FLATMAP must be delayed
because the delayed element references STREAM-FLATMAP.

Without a delay for the second element, the evaluator will attempt
to evaluate the value of the second element to be interleaved, and will
enter an infinite loop.

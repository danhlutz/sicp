# analyze-sequence

for a procedure with one body, the two versions produce similar results

Eva's version would produce a procedure like
```
(analyze body)
```

And Alyssa's version would produce
```
(lambda (env) ((analyze body) env))
```

For a procedure with three expressions in the body: 

Eva's version:

```
(lambda (env)
  ((analyze b1) env)
  (lambda (env)
    ((analyze b2) env)
    ((analyze b3) env)))
```

Alyssa's version:

```
(lambda (env)
  ((analyze b1) env)
  ((analyze b2) env))
  ((analyze b3) env))
  ```

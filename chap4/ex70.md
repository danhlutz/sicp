# adding assertions

We implement adding assertions this way: 

```
(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (let ((old-assertions THE-ASSERTIONS))
    (set! THE-ASSERTIONS
          (cons-stream assertion old-assertions))
    'ok))```

The LET binding creates a pointer to the old assertions 
that we can set as the tail of the cons-stream. 

If we leave out that let binding and just use: 
```
(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (set! THE-ASSERTIONS
        (cons-stream assertion THE-ASSERTIONS))
  'ok)```

We will produce an infinite stream of just the new assertion. 
All the old assertions will be lost.

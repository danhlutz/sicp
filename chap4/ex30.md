# evaluating sequences

## part A: using for-each

Ben points out that
```
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
```

will result in
```
57
321
88
```

This is in fact true because for-each uses "begin". Or maybe it's because
in each step display passes the value to the output, and it must be
evaluated to be displayed

## part B: Cy counters

Cy argues this sequence will proceed without the expected side effects

```
(define (p1 x) 
  (set! x (cons x '(2))))

(define (p2 x)
  (define (p 3)
    e
    x)
  (p (set! x (cons x '(2)))))

```

Here's my expected result in my lazy evaluator:

```
> (p1 1)
(1 2)
> (p2 1)
1
```

The second function does in fact just return the original parameter
because the set! procedure was not run. 

With Cy's change, both would result in (1 2)

## C

The behavior of part A does not change because each step in the procedure
is forced in that version

# Accumulating the results of queries

Ben's accumulator function won't work with the query system 
out of the box because the query system does not guarantee unique results
or even that it produces a stream that will terminate.

That means Ben's accumulator may accumulate the same result
multiple times. 

One way to handle this situation would be rather than to output a stream of results, accumulate the results of the query in new data object, 
called RESULTS

When a new result is added to RESULTS, results is first scanned
to make sure that the new result is unique. If it is unique, it is added
and the new RESULTS is returned. If not, RESULTS stays the same.

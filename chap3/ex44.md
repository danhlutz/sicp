# transfer money from account to account

I think for once Ben may actually be right. 

The difference between an exchange and a transfer is that an exchange must calculate the difference between the two accounts. 

The exchange must be serialized because this difference may be modified during the process of the exchange by another process.

In a transfer, the amount to transfer is given as a parameter. It does not need to be calculated and cannot be modified during the execution of the procedure.

(define (make-account balance)

First we run (define acc (make-account 50))

```
          +------------------
global -> | acc 
          +------------------
             |
             v
      +--------------
      | balance: 50
      | withdraw -> procedure
      | deposit -> procedure
      | dispatch -> procedure

```

Next we run ((acc 'deposit) 40)

```
          +------------------
global -> | acc 
          +------------------
             |
             v
      +--------------
      | balance: 50
      | withdraw -> procedure
      | deposit -> procedure
      | dispatch -> procedure
      +---------------
          ^      ^
          |      +---------+-----------
          |                | amount: 40
      +---------------
      | m: deposit
```

Next we run ((acc 'withdraw) 60)

```
          +------------------
global -> | acc 
          +------------------
             |
             v

          |                | amount: 60
      +---------------
      | m: withdraw

```

Finally, (define acc2 (make-account 100))

```
          +----------------------------
global -> | acc                  acc2

      | deposit -> procedure            | dispatch: ...

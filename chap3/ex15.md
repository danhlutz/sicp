# mutating shared list structures

Let's show how mutating two simlilar lists affects their structure, using box and pointer notation.

z1 is defined as

```
(define x (list 'a 'b))
(define z1 (cons x x))
```

Here's how set-to-wow! changes the structure of z1

```
z1 -> o o
      | |
      v v
  x-> o o -> o /
      |      |
      v      v
      'wow   'b
```

z2 is different. The car and cdr point to two different lists. Each list then points at the same symbols a and b. 

```
(define z2 (list 'a 'b) (list 'a 'b))
```

Here's how set-to-wow! mutates the structure

```
z2 ---> o o -> o /
 |      |      |
 |      v      v
 |     'a     'b
 |             ^
 |             |
 + ---> o o -> o /
        |
       'wow
```

# exchanges between accounts

We will be considering a program that withdraws from one account and deposits the money in another. 

```
(define (exchange account1 account 2)
  (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance)
                       (account2 'balance))))
    ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
    ((account2 'deposit) difference)))
```

and then procedure is serialized

```
(define (serialized-exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((s1 (account1 'serializer))
        (s2 (account2 'serializer)))
    ((s1 (s2 exchange))
      account 1
      account 2)))
```

## a simulation of multiple concurrent but serialized exchanges

         A   B   C
start    10  20  30
(x a b)  20  10  30
(x b a)  10  20  30
(x b c)  10  30  20
(x a b)  30  10  20

The starting differences between the three accounts are 10 and 20. 

Since exchange only exchanges the differences, any number of exchanges does not change the differences between accounts. Thus there will always be 10, 20, and 30 in the three accounts. 

## non-serialized exchange

             A  B  C
start        10 20 30
(x a b
a 'with -10) 20 20 30
(x b c)      20 30 20
(x a b
b 'dep -10)  20 20 20

The exchanges are all screwed up. But the total amount of money in the system is preserved. 

# non-serialized exchange and non-serialized accounts

              A  B  C
start         10 20 30
(x a b
diff=-10      10 20 30
a get bal 10
(x a c)       30 20 10
(x a b
a 'w -10      20 20 10
b 'd -10      20 10 10

Because A got its balance before the exchange with A and C completed, the later deposit to A didn't know that the balance of A had changed.

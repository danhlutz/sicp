# Calculating fibonaccis using streams

We can find the fibonacci numbers by combining the stream of Fibs with a delay. And by setting the two initial values. 

```
(define fibs
  (cons-stream 0
    (cons-stream 1
      (cons-stream (+ (stream-cdr fibs)
                      fibs)))))```

If we memoize delay, once we calculate a value of fibs, we save it and no longer need to calculate. Finding the nth fib takes n steps. 

If we don't memoize delay, we must re-calculate the value of fib at each step. This increases at 2^n.

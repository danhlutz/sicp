# a bad test-and-set! definition

This test-and-set! needs to do a better job of protecting its own state!

```
(define (test-and-set! cell)
  (if (car cell)
      true
      (begin (set-car! cell true)
             false)))```

(define my-mutex (make-mutex))

proc1 acquires the mutex
proc1 checks (car cell) and it's false! so it's about to set the cell ...
But then! proc2 acquires the mutex
It checks (car cell) and it's false! 
proc1 then sets the car of cell to true, but it's too late

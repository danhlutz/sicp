# concurrent modification of shared state

## part A: different resulting values

The starting balance of a shared account is $100. 

Concurrently Peter deposits $10, Paul withdraws $20, and Mary withdraws halfthe money in the account

```
Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $110
Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $90
Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $45

Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $110
Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $55
Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $35

Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $80
Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $90
Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $45

Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $80
Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $40
Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $50

Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $50
Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $60
Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $40

Mary  (set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2))) -> $50
Paul  (set! balance (- balance 20)) -> $30
Peter (set! balance (+ balance 10)) -> $40
```

Mary introduces non-deterministic behavior into this system. Out of the six possibilities, only the ones where she conducts her deposit at the end of the sequence produces a deterministic answer. The other answers all rely on the timing of her withdrawal. 

## part B: inter-leaving of operations 

STARTING BALANCE: 100

PAUL          PETER          MARY
balance: 100
                             balance: 100
                             new-value: 50
new-value: 80
                             set! 50
set! 80
              balance: 80
              new-value: 90
              set! 90

ENDING BALANCE: 90

At the beginning of the process there was $110 in the system.

At the end of this process:
Mary has  $50
Peter has  $0
Paul has  $20
Bank has  $90

For a total of $160 in the system!

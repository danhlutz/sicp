# calculating sqrt without a local variable

If you define sqrt as the stream

```
(define (sqrt x)
  (cons-stream 1.0
               (stream-map (lambda (guess)
                             (sqrt-improve guess x))
                           (sqrt x))))
```

Then scheme will have to re-evaluate (sqrt x) at each step. 

Since delay is memoized, each re-calculation will happen in linear time. But this is still less efficient than the original iteration thru the local variable guesses.

# a naive squarer

if you define squarer as ```(multiplier a a b)```, it will actually work one way -- if you set a value for a, the constraint system will produce a value for b

However, there are two problems: 

1) If you set a value for b, the constraint system will not produce a value for a since it can only find a value for one of the two multipliers if the othe multiplier has a value (when the product has a value)

2) The constraint system will not produce an error when you attempt to set b with a negative value, even though this should not be possible in our system using only real numbers

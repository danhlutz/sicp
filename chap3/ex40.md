# serializing functions

## consider all possible states of two unserialized executions

```
(define x 10)

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
```

100:       P1 gets value of x. P2 executes. P1 sets value of x.
1,000:     P2 gets value of x. P1 executes. P2 sets value of x.
10,000:    P1 gets first value of x. P2 executes. P1 gets second value of x and sets value of x. 
           OR P2 gets first and second values of x. P1 executes. P2 gets third value of x and sets value.
100,000:   P2 gets first value of x. P1 executes. P2 gets second and third value of x and sets value.
1,000,000: P1 executes completely, then P2. OR reversed.

## procedures serialized

```
(define x 10)

(define s (make-serializer))

(parallel-execute (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))```

1,000,000 is the result of either P1 then P2 or P2 then P1.

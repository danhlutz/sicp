# serializing operations

What are the options if two functions are serialized as below? 

```
(define x 10)

(define s (make-serializer))

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
```

The two originally serialized results are still possible:

101: If P1 executes all at once, and then P2
121: If P2 executes all at once, and then P1

But we must take into account one other possibilites: In this case, the squaring function serializes finding the value of x, but not setting it. Therefore, P2 may evaluated in between the two operations of P1.

100: If ```(* x x)``` is evaluated, then P2 evals, then x is set to 100
